            <h3>A company that values family</h3>

            <p>Jollibee was founded by Tony Tan and his family with its humble beginnings as an Ice Cream Parlor which later grew into an emerging global brand. At the heart of its success is a family-oriented approach to personnel management, making Jollibee
                one of the most admired employers in the region with an Employer of the Year Award from the Personnel Management Association of the Philippines, Best Employer in the Philippines Award from Hewitt Associated and a Top 20 Employer in Asia
                citation from the Asian Wall Street Journal.</p>
            <p>Aside from promoting a family oriented work environment, the brand’s values also reflect on their advertising and marketing. Jollibee knows their target audience very well: the traditional family and all communication materials focus on the
                importance of family values, making Jollibee the number one family fast food chain in the Philippines and a growing international QSR player.
            </p>
            <h3>A Well-Loved Brand</h3>

            <p>Customer satisfaction has always been key to Jollibee’s success. Never losing sight of its goals, Jollibee has grown to be one of the most recognized and highly preferred brands in the Philippines. Now the market leader among fast food chains
                in the Philippines, claiming a market share that totals to more than half of the entire industry.</p>
            <h3>Great tasting products and quality systems</h3>

            <p>Jollibee’s growth is due to its delicious menu line-up – like its superior-tasting Chickenjoy, mouth-watering Yumburger and Champ hamburger, and deliciously satisfying Jollibee Spaghetti -ably complemented with creative marketing programs,
                and efficient manufacturing and logistics facilities. It is made possible by well-trained teams that work in a culture of integrity and humility, fun and family-like. Every Jollibee outlet welcomes customers with a clean and warm in-store
                environment and friendly and efficient service.</p>
            <p>And it is this tried and tested formula of delivering great-tasting food, adherence to world class operating standards and the universal appeal of the family values the brand represents that are driving the expansion of Jollibee both locally
                and in the overseas market.</p>
            <h3>Widest store network in the Philippines and an emerging global player</h3>

            <p>Jollibee is the largest fast-food chain brand in the Philippines, operating a network of more than 1,400 stores. A dominant market leader in the Philippines, Jollibee enjoys the lion’s share of the local market that is more than all the other
                multinational fastfood brands in PH combined. The company has also embarked on an aggressive international expansion plan, with more than 270 international branches in the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, Macau, Brunei, Vietnam, Singapore,
                Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, Italy, and in the United Kingdom.</p>
            <h3>A Triumph for and of the Filipino and a source of Filipino pride.</h3>
            <p>Jollibee dedicated its continuous success to the Filipinos who have been there from the very start.</p>
            <p>Jollibee is so well-loved everytime a new store opens, especially overseas, Filipinos always form long lines to the store. It is more than home for them. It is a stronghold of heritage and monument of Filipino pride.</p>

            <h3>FSC Standards</h3>
            <p>Jollibee’s phenomenal growth owes much to its strict and committed adherence to high standards as symbolized by “F.S.C.”: Food (F) served to the public must meet the company’s excellence standards or it will not be served at all; the Service
                (S) must be fast and courteous; and Cleanliness (C), from kitchen to utensils, must always be maintained. Jollibee is proud of its employees who carry out their jobs.</p>
            <p>Jollibee recognizes them by providing the highest compensation and benefits packages in the fastfood industry, and modern and comprehensive training programs. Managers are regularly updated on the latest store operations systems, people-oriented
                management skills, among others. Service crews are trained on various store stations and food-service innovations. Jollibee also offers career opportunities for qualified and exceptional crew members to further their food-service careers
                as managers.</p>
            <p>Store operations are ably supported by professionals who are experts in Marketing, Computer Management and Engineering.</p>

            <h3>The Commisionary</h3>
            <p>Store operations are ably supported by professionals who are experts in Marketing, Computer Management and Engineering.</p>
            <p>There are three Commissary System sites: Santolan, Pasig City; Mandaue City, Cebu; and the central site in Canlubang, Laguna. The System, which operates 24/7, manages Jollibee’s total supply chain process.</p>
            <p>The Jollibee Pasig City commissary has production lines for breads and sauces, and is the distribution center for North Manila and North Luzon. In 1996, Jollibee opened the Vismin Foods Corporation (VFC) in Mandaue City, Cebu to service the
                Visayas and Mindanao areas. VFC has its own bread, pie, sauce, and frozen patty lines.</p>
            <p>The Laguna commissary is the biggest and most advanced in the country and among Asia’s best. Operated by Zenith Foods Corporation (ZFC), a full subsidiary of Jollibee, the newest commissary is on a 6-hectare property in the Calmelray Industrial
                Park. Aided by custom-made mechanized equipment, the production lines are for the marinated Chicken Joy, frozen patties and pies, breads, sauces, hotdogs and other meat products, and dry blended goods. ZFC can service over 800 Jollibee
                and Greenwich stores.</p>
            <p>The chicken marination line can produce as many as 150,000 pieces a day while about 480,000 hamburger patties a day is turned out by the frozen patty line. The breadline is designed to match the volume output of patties, i.e. also about 480,000
                pieces a day. The pie line can produce as much as 157,000 pocket pies in a 20-hour operating day. Currently, pies are exported to Jollibee stores in Hong Kong, Guam, Saipan, Brunei, and the USA. Various sauce products are processed in
                the ZFC sauceline including those for the Jollibee bestsellers, spaghetti and palabok.</p>
            <p>A professionally staffed Technical Services Team supports the maintenance of an internationally accepted quality management system that further ensures the quality and safety of the commissary manufactured food products. High caliber teams
                from Engineering, Human Resources, Information Management, Finance and Accounting likewise provide support to the Manufacturing and Logistics operations of the Commissary.</p>
            <p>Proof of Jollibee’s adherence to high quality standards is the various awards it garnered for the commissaries: in 1997, the commissary in Pasig earned the Outstanding Industrial Plant in the National Capital Region from the Laguna Lake Development
                Authority and the Most Improved Industry awarded by the Sagip Pasig Movement while Commissary Plant Engineer Romy P. Fernandez was awarded as one of the Top Ten Most Outstanding Pollution Control Officers of the Philippines.</p>
            <p>In 1998 also, the frozen patty line in the Pasig commissary was awarded an ISO 9002 certification by the SGS (Societe’ Generale Surveillance) Yarsely, an international certification body. 2004 is a banner year for Vismin Foods Corporation
                (VFC) who has been assessed and certified by the National Meat Inspection Commission of the Department of Agriculture, to have fully met the requirements and standards of Good Manufacturing Practice, reinforcing the commissary’s “AAA”
                accreditation granted by the same agency.</p>
